          <h2><a></a>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Connection is used to establish authentication with other Zoho or
            third-party services to perform integration with them. You can
            consider&nbsp;connection as a way to login to any Zoho or
            third-party service. So, if you're already logged in
            (connected)&nbsp;to a particular service, you can always access your
            data stored in those services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once a connection is created and connected, you can use it in Deluge
            <a>integration tasks</a> or <a>invoke URL</a> scripts to perform
            REST operations on the target service from the required Zoho
            service. For example, to access your Dropbox account using their
            REST APIs from your Zoho CRM, you can create a Dropbox connection,
            connect to it, and use the connection link name in
            <a>invoke URL</a> Deluge task. The invoke URL task will perform the
            specified API call to your connected Dropbox account.
          </p>
          <h2><a></a>Services</h2>
          <p>
            Services are the connectors using which you can create your
            connections. The following are the types of services:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Default services:</strong>&nbsp;These are pre-configured
              services. You can easily create a connection using default
              services and authenticate it using your credentials.
              <a>Learn more</a>.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  To view the available default services, click on
                  <strong>Default services</strong> under Services in the left
                  pane.&nbsp;<br /><img />
                </li>
                <li>
                  The default services are categorized based on the type of the
                  service. To narrow down your choices, click on the dropdown on
                  top of the page and choose your required category.<br /><img />
                </li>
                <li>
                  To search for a specific service, type the service name in the
                  search bar at the top right corner.<br /><img />
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Custom services:</strong>&nbsp;If your required service is
              not available in the default services list, you can configure it
              on your own. Once the service is configured, you or any member of
              your organization can create as many connections as
              required&nbsp;using it by providing credentials.&nbsp;
            </li>
          </ol>
          <div>
            <strong>Note:</strong> You can create more than one connection for
            the same default or custom service.

                      Consider the following scenarios to understand the
                      "Use&nbsp;credential of login user" switch and shared
                      connections:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Let's assume you want to create and publish a
                        <a>Zoho Cliq bot</a> for everyone in the organization
                        that will upload the files forwarded to it into the
                        user’s Dropbox account. To achieve this integration, you
                        must create a connection to Dropbox and use it in the
                        invoke URL Deluge task. And while creating the
                        connection, you must turn on the "user credential of
                        login user" switch so that the users can authenticate
                        your connection using their credentials. Hence, the
                        files will be uploaded to the user’s Dropbox account. If
                        the switch was not turned on, the connection will run
                        using the credentials of the connection owner, and the
                        files sent by all the users will be uploaded to your
                        (connection owner’s) Dropbox account.<br /><br />In this
                        example, the "Use credential of login user" switch
                        should be turned on, and all the bot users will
                        authenticate your Dropbox connection using their
                        credentials. Therefore, a copy of your connection will
                        be listed under "Shared Connections" in their
                        connections page while it will be listed under “My
                        Connections” in your connections page.<br />&nbsp;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Imagine you want to create and publish a &nbsp;<a
                          >Zoho Cliq slash command</a
                        >
                        for everyone in the team&nbsp;that will fetch the team's
                        task list&nbsp;from Zoho Projects. Unlike the previous
                        example, you need not turn on the "Use credentials of
                        login user" switch while creating the
                        connection&nbsp;because every&nbsp;user wants&nbsp;to
                        access the same data. So, rather than encouraging every
                        single user to authenticate your connection in order to
                        access your team's common data, you&nbsp;can use allow
                        them to use your connection to communicate with Zoho
                        Projects.<br /><br />In this example, the users will not
                        authenticate your connection using their credentials,
                        instead, they make use of your connection as such. So,
                        this connection will not be listed in the user’s
                        connections page.​
