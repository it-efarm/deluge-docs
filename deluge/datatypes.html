      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In simple terms, if a <a>variable</a> is used to refer to stored data,
        the data type is used to refer to the type of data.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        For a computer application, a number, a letter, and a date are all the
        same, a piece of information, or in other words, data.&nbsp;But
        different types of data cannot always react with each other. For
        example, it is illogical to multiply a number with a date. Since, in
        programming, there is often a need to perform operations between
        different types of data, there arises a need to differentiate between
        the types. And this is exactly the purpose of data types.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data types define what type the given data is, and as a result, how the
        user can use the data.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>The following data types are supported in Deluge.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a><strong>Text</strong></a> - The text, datatype represents a
          sequence of characters. These characters can be text characters,
          special characters, numeric characters, or other valid input, and must
          be enclosed in double quotes.<br />Eg. Name field, Email field, and
          more.<br />&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          <a><strong>Number</strong></a> -&nbsp;&nbsp;The Number datatype
          represents integer values. It does not include decimal values.
          However, Number datatype can be used to perform operations with
          decimal values, in which case the end result becomes a decimal
          datatype.<br />Eg. Number field, Auto Number field, and more.<br />&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          <a><strong>Decimal</strong></a> - The decimal type represents decimal
          values, commonly used for values such as currency or percentage.<br />Eg.
          Currency field, Percentage field, and more.<br />&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          <a><strong>Boolean</strong></a
          >&nbsp;- The decision datatype represents the values - true and false.
          The&nbsp;values True or False must not be enclosed in quotes. And the
          values are not case-sensitive.<br />Eg. Decision Box field.<br />&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          <a><strong>Date-Time</strong></a> -&nbsp;The date-time datatype
          represents date and time values in a variety of formats, as specified
          under settings in the zoho Product you use. Date-time values must be
          enclosed within single quotes. A date can also be declared without
          time, in which case the hours, mins, and seconds are taken as 0 by
          default.<br />Eg. Date field, Date-Time fields, Prediction field, and
          more.<br />&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          <a><strong>Time</strong></a> -&nbsp;The&nbsp;time&nbsp;datatype
          represents time values in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats. This data
          type works independently of a date value.<br />Eg. Time field.<br />&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          <a><strong>List</strong></a> -&nbsp;List is a data-type which can hold
          a collection of values. And each value present in the list is called
          an element. A list can contain elements of different types say number,
          text, date etc. grouped together. So you can store a number, a text, a
          date etc as different elements in the same list. The elements in a
          list are marked using an index value.<br />Eg. Checkbox field,
          Multiselect field, and more.<br />&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          <a><strong>Key-Value</strong></a> - Key-Value is a data-type which
          holds a collection of key-value pairs. The keys can be used to
          retrieve the corresponding values. Keys&nbsp;must be unique. If the
          same key is specified again, the new value will overwrite the previous
          value.<br />Eg.&nbsp;
          <div>
            <pre>ItemQuantity = {"Item" : "Magic_Mouse", "Number" : 23};</pre>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a><strong>Collection</strong></a> - The collection datatype&nbsp;is
          used to store both a list of elements or key-value pairs. Each
          collection variable at a time can act only as a list variable
          containing elements, or as a map variable containing key-value pairs.
          It cannot contain list elements and key-value pairs together in a
          single collection.<br />Eg.
          <div>
            <pre>
&nbsp;materials = Collection("Mobile phone","Laptop","Adapter");</pre
            >
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a><strong>File</strong></a> - The&nbsp;File&nbsp;is a unique type of
          data. Files in Deluge must be fetched from the web or cloud service.
          It doesn't operate on offline files. There are several built-in
          functions called <a>File functions</a> that operate on FILE datatype.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div>
        <strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Null</strong> is a built-in constant with no specific value
            and doesn't belong to any data type.
          </li>
        </ul>
