          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Deluge</strong>, or Data Enriched Language for the Universal
            Grid Environment, is an online scripting language integrated with
            Zoho services. It enables users to add logic to their applications
            incrementally, making it more powerful and robust.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            UI-based actions like point-and-click are limited in their scope.
            After a certain point, if we want something to be very complex, we
            need custom scripts to perform custom actions.&nbsp;Deluge can make
            that possible. For example, if you only need to collect data in an
            app like Zoho Creator, which is straightforward, you can do it using
            drag-and-drop. However, if you want to do more than that, say send
            an email on form submission,&nbsp;fetch data or update data, or any
            other similar action, then you would need Deluge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deluge is Zoho's proprietary language, and is built by Zoho.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <h2>Is Deluge a programming language or a scripting language?</h2>
          <p>Deluge is a scripting language.</p>
          <p>
            A programming language, in a nutshell, is a sequence of instructions
            to enable the computer to do something. It's like writing down the
            steps it takes to do something. These instructions are written in a
            programming language, and the stuff that these instructions
            manipulate&nbsp;is different types of data, like numbers or words.
          </p>
          <p>
            A scripting language, on the other hand, is a form of programming
            language that is used to create scripts or bits of code. Most
            commonly, scripting languages are written to facilitate enhanced
            features of websites. For example, when you search something on
            Google, the results are dynamic. This is because of scripts. The
            Google search itself is processed on the server (or, in other words,
            done using a programming language) but it's enhanced with features
            like dynamic auto-suggest using scripts that run on the user's
            browser.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            When compared to programming languages, scripting languages are easy
            to learn and use, and do not require much programming knowledge or
            experience. Complex tasks can be performed in relatively few steps
            using scripts, unlike programming languages, which are generally
            lengthy. Apart from these basic differences, there are a few
            technical differences as well, but what makes a programming language
            or a scripting language has nothing to do with
            technicalities.&nbsp;A scripting language is available to the user
            at runtime, and allows the user to direct the behavior of the main
            program. And that is precisely what Deluge is, to Zoho Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a programming language, you write a large number other things
            apart from the custom action you are trying to achieve. Basically,
            there are a lot of dependencies you need to work out to trigger your
            custom action. In a scripting language like Deluge, you simply write
            the script for the action that you want to achieve. This is because
            we have already taken care of the dependencies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deluge is our own scripting language, which you can use to write
            logic and automate actions across multiple Zoho applications.
          </p>
          <h2>Where can you use Deluge?</h2>
          <p>
            Over forty Zoho Products currently support Deluge, which are listed
            in the table below. When an action happens in one of these Zoho
            applications, it can trigger a&nbsp;Deluge script that does some
            workflow action for us.

          <p>
            Generally, you'll be using Deluge to manipulate data in some way,
            such as creating or updating a record, or deleting a record that
            exists in other Zoho or external applications. You can also choose
            when that action happens. We have already defined all the events
            across Zoho applications in which you can trigger Deluge scripts.
            The following image displays a few sample events in which Deluge
            functions can be triggered.<br />​<img />
          </p>
          <h2>Unique features of Deluge Scripting</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Automation</strong>​: Perform automated tasks, like
              sending automated text messages to employees when visitors arrive
              to meet them,&nbsp;or an automated email notification when your
              stock is running low. You can also perform calculations.&nbsp;For
              example, If the total cart value exceeds a particular amount, you
              can automatically apply a discount and calculate the total
              cost.&nbsp;This is one of the most common use cases.<br />&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Integration:&nbsp;</strong>Perform seamless integration
              between Zoho services, or between your Zoho service and any other
              third party service. For example, when a new candidate is
              short-listed in Zoho Recruit, data can be automatically pushed to
              the Zoho Calendar account of the HR representative who is going to
              interview the candidate. Alternatively, take the example of Zoho
              Bug tracker, which is a product used to track issues and bugs. All
              the bugs found can be pushed to Zoho Desk, which is another
              Zoho&nbsp;product to track customer tickets.&nbsp;This integration
              is not only limited to Zoho Products. Using Deluge, you can make
              API calls to any other applicable external service.<br />&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>User-friendly Syntax:&nbsp;</strong>The Deluge Script
              syntax is easy to read and understand. The process of creating
              powerful application is fun, easy, and quick.<br />&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Code is Data:&nbsp;</strong>Deluge Script has no concrete
              syntax. The syntax you see is just a "skin". The actual code is
              stored as abstract syntax (i.e. a whole bunch of tables) in the
              database. In future, users will be able to generate the same code
              in their own favorable syntax. For example, Sam can edit the code
              in the standard Deluge syntax, while Lucy can edit the same code
              in her preferred Perl syntax.<br />&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Query Integrated Language:&nbsp;</strong>Deluge Script
              bridges the gap between the program logic written in a high-level
              programming language and the data that it operates upon. It brings
              the expressiveness of SQL closer to the core application
              logic.&nbsp;This means the query is integrated at the language
              levels.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Built-in functions:&nbsp;</strong>Execute pre-built
              functions to perform common actions with different functions
              available exclusively for different data-types.
            </li>
          </ul>
