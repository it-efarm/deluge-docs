      <h1>Custom Integrations</h1>
      <p>
        You can integrate your Zoho Services with various cloud services such as
        Twitter, Google, Salesforce etc., to perform various actions in them
        directly from your Zoho Service. The integration between Zoho Services
        and external services takes place by adding a connection for each
        service. The connections can be utilized using the invoke URL task,
        which leverages the Connections to perform the integration. To sum it
        up, the following two things are involved in performing a successful
        integration:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a
            ><strong><u>Connections</u></strong></a
          >
          - Connections are used to specify the third-party service with which
          your Zoho Service will be integrated, along with other details like
          the Connection Name, Authentication Type, etc.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          <a
            ><strong><u>Invoke Url</u></strong></a
          >
          - The Invoke Url task is used to integrate your Zoho service with
          third-party apps and perform required actions, through Connections.
        </li>
      </ul>
