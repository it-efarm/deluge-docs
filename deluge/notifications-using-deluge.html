      <p>
        Notifications are messages such as alerts or warnings, usually used to
        notify a&nbsp;user whenever an event occurs. When notification scripts
        are executed, custom notifications are&nbsp;sent to an email
        address/phone number, or to a particular device&nbsp;in case of push
        notifications. For example, you can send notifications to
        inform&nbsp;users that their submission or update was successfully
        received.&nbsp;You can keep everyone updated with notifications about
        the latest data coming into or going out of your Zoho Service using the
        following options:
