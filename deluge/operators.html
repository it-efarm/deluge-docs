      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        An operator, in a programming language, is a symbol that represents an
        action. It tells the program to perform specific mathematical,
        relational or logical actions on given values to produce a final
        result.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Operations are usually performed between two values or variables or
        expressions, and those values are called as operands. So in a simple
        operation like 3 + 2 , the addition or the plus is the operator and 3
        and 2 are the operands. The operands can be expressions, Zoho Service
        fields, or variables declared in Deluge.
      </p>
      <h2>Why do we need Operators?</h2>
      <p>
        Programming languages, such as Deluge, perform consistent data
        manipulation like calculations for instance. And there is continuous
        need for data to interact with each other in various forms such as
        performing arithmetic operations, concatenating string values, comparing
        given values. And all these operations are achieved by using the
        required type of operator.
      </p>
      <h2>Types of Operators</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong><a>Arithmetic Operators</a></strong
          >: Arithmetic operators are used to perform calculations on numerical
          values, as well as to concatenate&nbsp;two or more string
          values.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          <a><strong>Assignment Operators</strong></a
          >: Assignment Operators are of two types --&nbsp;Simple assignment
          operator&nbsp;and&nbsp;Compound assignment operator. The simple
          assignment operator assigns&nbsp;the value of the right operand to the
          variable (or the field)&nbsp;specified in the left operand. Compound
          assignment operators consist of a binary operator and the simple
          assignment operator. They perform the operation of the binary operator
          on both operands and store the result of that operation into the left
          operand.<br />&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          <a><strong>Logical Operators</strong></a
          >: Logical operators are typically used with multiple conditions in a
          criteria. Each condition returns a boolean value, and the logical
          operators used to connect the&nbsp;conditions determine the overall
          boolean value of the criteria.<br />&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          <a><strong>Relational Operators</strong></a
          >: Relational operators compare two given values and return a boolean
          value, most commonly used in&nbsp;<a>conditional statements</a>.
