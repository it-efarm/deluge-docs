      <h1>System Variables</h1>
      <p>
        System variables are a special class of predefined variables,&nbsp;which
        are already defined by the system, and values are assigned by the system
        itself. These variables&nbsp;are read-only.&nbsp;They contain values
        that cannot or should not be changed by the user.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        These variables are used to refer to common information, like the email
        address of the logged-in user or app admin, the device type used to
        access the application, the current date, and so on.<br />&nbsp;

        The system variable <strong>zoho.device.type</strong> is used to get the
        information of the end device type. The variable will return the device
        types <strong>web</strong>, <strong>phone</strong>, or
        <strong>tablet</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, in the development of a shopping application, you can make
        use of this system variable to fetch the
        <strong>device type</strong> and then adjust the interface elements,
        styling, and layout based on the user's preferred device type. This
        ensures an optimized journey for users accessing their Creator
        application platform across <em>web</em>, <em>tablets</em>, or
        <em>mobile devices</em>. The super admins and admins who manage the
        application's dashboard and review analytics, or the users shopping, can
        each experience the application tailored to their device, thereby
        enhancing user engagement.
      </p>

        <span
          ><strong>Note</strong>: If a user accesses a Creator application as a </span
        ><a><span>PWA</span></a
        ><span>, then the device return type will be </span
        ><em><span>"phone" </span></em><span>or </span
        ><em><span>"tablet"</span></em
        ><span>.</span>

        A few system variables have values that differ from user to user. Which
        means, they are specific to the user account.&nbsp;For example, the
        system variable <strong>zoho.loginuserid</strong> which returns the
        email id of the logged in user. For every individual account, this value
        will vary. And a few system variables are the same for all user
        accounts. For example, <strong>zoho.currentdate</strong> which returns
        the current date value.
      </p>
      <p>
        The availability of system variables depends on the product you
        use.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        1) The following snippet sets the Date field with the current date when
        the form loads.
      </p>
      <div>input.Date = zoho.currentdate;</div>
      <p>
        2) The following snippet returns the link to the required application.
      </p>
      <div>
        baseURL = (("http://app.zohocreator.com/" + zoho.adminuser) + "/") +
        zoho.appname;
      </div>
      <p>
        3) The following snippet displays the device type that's used by a user
        to access the application.
      </p>
      <div>info zoho.device.type; &nbsp; // returns "web"/"phone"/"tablet"</div>
