      <h2><a></a>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        A variable is the address of a temporary value in the computer memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every time we declare a variable with a value, it gets stored in a
        certain address in RAM. And the variable name is the usual way to refer
        to the stored value.
      </p>
      <h2><a></a>How is a variable useful?</h2>
      <p>
        Variables don't just act as virtual addresses for information, but they
        also allow us to manipulate its value as the program runs.<br /><br />There
        may be times when you&nbsp;need to use a particular&nbsp;value in
        multiple places in a code. In such cases you can declare a variable once
        and use it wherever required. If there is an update required to that
        value, you do not have to&nbsp;update it in multiple places in
        the&nbsp;code,&nbsp;instead you can just
        update&nbsp;the&nbsp;variable.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, imagine you have this calculation
        <strong>1+1+1</strong> which you use in multiple places in your code:
      </p>
      <p>
        When you have to update the calculation, for example, changing it to
        <strong>1*2*3</strong>,&nbsp;you will need to update the calculation in
        all instances in the code. Instead, you can assign the original
        calculation to a variable, and then simply update the calculation just
        once in the variable:
      </p>
      <div>math = 1+1+1;<br />math = 1*2*3;</div>
      <p>
        One change to the definition of a variable is much easier than searching
        for ‘1+1+1’ and replacing it with ‘1*2*3'.&nbsp;Therefore, the load of
        multiple database calls to retrieve the same information is
        negated&nbsp;using a variable which is stored&nbsp;once and used
        wherever needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Variables also provide a way of labelling data with a descriptive name,
        so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and
        ourselves.
      </p>
      <h2><a></a>Variables in Deluge</h2>
      <p>
        Variables in Deluge&nbsp;are dynamically-typed. Unlike other languages,
        users don't have to declare the data type of the variable before using
        it.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        The variables in Deluge do not have a global scope, i.e, they
        can&nbsp;be utilized only in the action script where they are declared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically, assignment of values to variables happens either at the top
        of a script (if the variable is used widely)&nbsp;or as close to where
        it is used. This helps readability and maintenance of code. The variable
        is on the left,&nbsp;followed by an equal sign, and again followed by
        the item being assigned, as shown below:
      </p>
      <div>tax = 0.1;</div>
      <h2><a></a>Things to keep in mind:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Variable names can begin with upper case letters, lower case
          letters,&nbsp;or underscore (_) and can contain upper case letters,
          lower case letters, numbers, and underscore(_).
        </li>
        <li>
          Variable names cannot have spaces. Use an underscore(_) where you need
          spaces.
        </li>
        <li>
          Variable names are case-sensitive. "var" and "Var" will be considered
          as 2 different variable names.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use full words instead of cryptic abbreviations while declaring a
          variable. It makes it easier to understand the code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reserved keywords like <strong>true</strong>, <strong>false</strong>,
          <strong>null</strong>, <strong>void</strong> and&nbsp;<strong
            >return</strong
          >
          cannot be declared as variables.
        </li>
      </ul>
